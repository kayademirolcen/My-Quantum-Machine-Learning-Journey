# My-Quantum-Machine-Learning-Journey
Hi there! My name is Kaya, and I'm a final year Physics student at University College London. Recently, I decided to get more serious with my quantum ambitions, and learn quantum programming and quantum machine learning! In order to track my studies and also share my work with like-minded self-learners, I decided to upload my progress to this repository. I'm planning to dump all of my coding and practice here.

I am planning to familiarise myself with PennyLane and Qiskit, but I'm also taking "DelftX QCST1x Machine Learning for Semiconductor Quantum Devices" course on edX as well, so this repository will probably include some work related to all these 3. Hopefully if I do any internships and research as well, all will go here too!


I'm aiming to include as much theory and commentary behind all the work I upload here, for both mines and readers sake. 


I hope this will be helpful to anyone trying to learn quantum computing!
